# EconStockBot

Howdy, welcome to the econ stock bot.

This bot is made to disregard the petty mortal conflicts of picking stocks, and puts it all to chance. It makes no meaningful difference anyway, so leaving RNGsus to decide your fate is likely the best course of action. 

Provide it with a list of stocks to buy and a list of your stocks to sell, and it'll tell you what to buy and sell. 

If anyone actually wants to use this but doesn't know how to open a python file, ping me on discord and I'd be happy to make the program into an exe file for ease of access. For now, it remains pure code, as I don't want to invest that much time into a thing that likely nobody will use. (they said having already invested hours in adapting their program for public use)

Regardless, enjoy the code, and I hope it makes you some fake internet money!
