# EconStockBot

Howdy, welcome to the econ stock bot.
This bot is made to randomly select a stock from a weighted list.

Don't have a weighted list? Just pop yout list in the final variable, and you're all set!

Full instructions can be found inside main.py. The only thing I'm not giving you is
the list of stocks. You're gonna have to find those yourself!
